## Launched Instagram

- Got the first bit of content up on Instagram, [a short tutorial video on running the stinky fish workshop warmup](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C6bgMzMI5WH/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==).
- [@megafauna.cph](https://instagram.com/megafauna.cph)
- Recorded three more sessions, though only two of them really "turned out"
- This style of marketing is a medium term bet for me on a product I'm developing, plus it forces me to refine my language on teaching these facilitation techniques.
- Learning final cut pro properly is proving interesting on a macbook air.

## Product Dev

- Round 1 prototype of a facilitation game up and running, though no first design survives first contact with a user.

## Site Refinement

- Starting to work on a text and function redesign of the website
- Some testing and feedback one this first version has switched up my opinion on what is what.

## Etc

- Pizza catch up with [Kevin Andersen](https://main.kevinandersen.dk/), a good friend and founder of Super Ultra (also in my board game group)
