## A New Puppy

- My dog (a greyhound named Moon) passed away this passed summer, and we've been planning on getting a new dog for some time.
- Nell, an 8 week old whippet puppy, joined us on Monday. It's been predictably chaotic.

## Short Week

- Because of Nell and easter weekend, this was a very short week.
- The primary focus was on researching a research grant opportunity (plus one or two others), following up on some leads, and finally locking in my accounts.

## Open Source Start

- I started on a small open source project over the weekend to better learn Node-Red.
- You can take a look at it here: [github.com/lovettbarron/node-red-tractive](https://github.com/lovettbarron/node-red-tractive)
- This one is just for learning, but expect a few more in the future to support more immersive workshop experiences.

## Academic Connections

- One of the advantages of being a Canadian living in Denmark is the rich network shared between the two arctic nations
- There's a pretty interesting research project that seems very much in the Megafauna wheelhouse, so applying for that became a priority.
