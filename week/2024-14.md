## Marketing Course

- Week started with a marketing course put on by Iværksætterdanmark, focused on using social media marketing.
- Bunch of interesting take aways, and a chance to connect with my contact there as well
- Highlighted how much work I need to do to get that piece in place — including setting up my social assets and gameplan for Megafauna.

## Coaching

- Got confirmation of my certification from Animas, which was a big excitement. [The certification lives here!](https://app.diplomasafe.com/en-US/diploma/d8c21704e19d7c2731f2eddf00fbea6540506033a)
- New coaching clients and intros coming up, which is exciting.

## Map Building

- Starting to build out a map of locations within Copenhagen for workshops and visitors
- Built in LeafletJS, it's going to live on this site and hopefully should help you the next time you need to book an offsite or workshop space in Copenhagen!

## Etc

- I was interviewed briefly by Bloomberg TV about living in the UN17 Village in Copenhagen
- Working on a list of recommendations for Copenhagen visitors, specifically for those hoping to host workshops or retreats here
- Some CAD work for the upcoming card deck
