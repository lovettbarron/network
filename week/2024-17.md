## Arctic Sustainability

- Connecting with a group of researchers on the Arctic sustainability grant
- Partnership discussions with the nordic cohort

## Sales Coaching

- Worked with Claus Birkedal, a sales coach from Erhvervshus Hovdestaden
- Practice around call scripts and various other techniques, was an incredibly helpful session
- While I'm a strong communicator, this type of selling is something I have a lot of discomfort with, so the fact that these types of resources are available to new businesses in Denmark is wickedly helpful

## Etc

- Regular catchup call with [Justin](https://www.justinpickard.net/). Always learn something new, or generate some interesting tangent with him.
