A quick demo of what one might do with the THOR dataset that lives onÂ [Data.mil](http://data.mil/). Andrew and Brandon created the demo as a "hackathon" project to demonstrate a quick data application that might be built over a weekend's worth of time using the THOR WW1 data, Backbone, leaflet, and wikipedia to fill in some of the narrative content.
