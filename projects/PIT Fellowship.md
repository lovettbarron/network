As one of the first Public Interest Tech Fellows, my focus was on sustainable business models for public interest technology. In addition to writing and supporting the projects of other fellows, I created and continue to maintain the Grant Calculator project.

- Collection of writing and interviews I did over the course of the fellowship.
