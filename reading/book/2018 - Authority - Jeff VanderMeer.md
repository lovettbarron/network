## Highlights
- “The fish rots from the head.” Fish rotted all over, cell corruption being nonhierarchical and not caste-driven, but point taken. ([Location 187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GET18P2&location=187))
- It wasn’t true wilderness, was comfortingly close to civilization, but existed just enough apart to create a boundary. This was what most people wanted: to be close to but not part of. ([Location 1049](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GET18P2&location=1049))
- The border had come down in the early morning, on a day, a date, that no one outside of the Southern Reach remembered or commemorated. Just that one inexplicable event had killed an estimated fifteen hundred people. How did you factor ghosts into any terroir? Did they deepen the flavor, or did they make things dry, chalky, irreconcilable? The taste in Control’s mouth was bitter.

- Because more and more in the modern Internet era you came across isolated instances of a mind virus or worm: brains that self-washed, bathed in received ideologies that came down from on high, ideologies that could remain dormant or hidden for years, silent as death until they struck. ([Location 1992](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GET18P2&location=1992))
- He used guns, but he didn’t like them and didn’t like relying on them. They smelled like their perspective. ([Location 3110](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00GET18P2&location=3110))
