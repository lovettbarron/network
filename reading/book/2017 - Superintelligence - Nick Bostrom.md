## Highlights
- Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make, provided that the machine is docile enough to tell us how to keep it under control. ([Location 375](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LOOCGB2&location=375))
- “As soon as it works, no one calls it AI anymore.” ([Location 622](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LOOCGB2&location=622))
- The computer scientist Donald Knuth was struck that “AI has by now succeeded in doing essentially everything that requires ‘thinking’ but has failed to do most of what people and animals do ‘without thinking’—that, somehow, is much harder!” ([Location 632](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LOOCGB2&location=632))
