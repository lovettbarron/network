## Highlights
- When you enable the Edge Length option, you will see the numeric value for any edge selected in the 3D Viewport ([Location 102](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG2KX55&location=102))
- Hold the SHIFT key to get two points in a straight line Keep the CTRL key pressed to capture key points like vertices and a more precise measurement ([Location 108](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG2KX55&location=108))
- Tip: To type different units, you must enter advance mode before using your keyboard. Press the = key before type a length. ([Location 135](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG2KX55&location=135))
- To fix that scale and reset your factor to one, we have to apply the transformation. You can apply a scale by either pressing CTRL+A or use the Object → Apply menu. There you will be able to choose between Scale, Rotation, or use them both (Figure 1.19). ([Location 191](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG2KX55&location=191))
- As a good practice, you can always press CTRL+A and choose “Rotation & Scale” before starting to add custom properties. ([Location 195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG2KX55&location=195))
- The object origins serve as the reference point for object location and also a pivot point for scales and rotations. ([Location 200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG2KX55&location=200))
