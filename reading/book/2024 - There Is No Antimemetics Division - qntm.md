## Highlights
- SCP-055 is a "self-keeping secret" or "anti-meme". ([Location 22](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHHQRM2&location=22))
- information about SCP-055's physical appearance "leaks" out of a human mind soon after such an observation. ([Location 27](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHHQRM2&location=27))
- There are entities and phenomena which harvest and consume information, particularly information about themselves. ([Location 86](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHHQRM2&location=86))
- You're supposed to be on these, the same as me and everybody on my staff. It's the only way we can work. You forgot to take a pill, and then you forgot all the information that the pills were helping you retain. You forgot why you were taking them, who gave them to you, where to get more. You forgot about me, and my entire department. And now I have to bring you up to speed." ([Location 116](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHHQRM2&location=116))
- SCP-4739 is a powerful, slow-acting antimemetic kill agent taking the appearance of a male Caucasian business executive calling itself "Alastair Grey". SCP-4739 is attracted to dense clusters of organically-stored information - essentially, extremely knowledgeable, complicated, interesting people. ([Location 222](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHHQRM2&location=222))
- No antimemetic SCPs had even been observed up to that point — the entire operation was a shot in the dark — and yet the team immediately struck gold. Passive black holes of information, active predatory infovores, unrememberable worms which covered the human skin like dust mites... contagious bad news, self-sealing secrets, living murders, Chinatowns. ([Location 330](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHHQRM2&location=330))
- "This is not the first Antimemetics Division. Before 1976, there was another one. I was part of that division; possibly, I led it. Certainly, I am the only known survivor of it. Something happened to that team. Some antimemetic force chewed up and swallowed the idea of the Antimemetics Division itself. I was let off lightly; I lived. The rest of those people, whoever they were, however many of them there were, are missing without trace." ([Location 344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHHQRM2&location=344))
- Marness has regressed a little way past senior management, the realm where most problems were solved by saying the correct words, and into a time where he survived through physical fitness, situational alertness and hands-on experience. ([Location 361](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHHQRM2&location=361))
- "We got looped. It was textbook. We built the unthinkable bomb and test-detonated it... and it worked perfectly. The bomb destroyed itself, and erased its own successful detonation, and flattened all the knowledge which had gone together to build it. We forgot that we had ever built the bomb at all, and started over. ([Location 371](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHHQRM2&location=371))
- "If you know it exists, it knows you exist. The more you know about it, the more it knows about you. If you can see it, it can see you. And you can see it. You've been looking right at it all afternoon." ([Location 408](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHHQRM2&location=408))
- The whole division is looped! We start the division, we run headlong into this thing, and either it eats us, or we wipe ourselves out in self-preservation. ([Location 422](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHHQRM2&location=422))
- Wheeler compares the current size of her division with her best estimate of what it should be. Maybe she needs a few more key people here and there... So, assuming the division was fully staffed before the event, maybe those empty roles are the people who died this time around. ([Location 454](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHHQRM2&location=454))
- A commendable act, by someone now only known to exist because of that single act. ([Location 456](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHHQRM2&location=456))
- Asynchronous research — whereby the research topic is forgotten entirely between iterations, and rediscovered over and over — is a perfectly standard practice in the Antimemetics Division, and her people ought to be better trained than this. There should be an obvious single document to read first which makes sense of the rest. A primer— ([Location 497](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHHQRM2&location=497))
- SCP-3125 pervades all of reality except for volumes which have been specifically shielded from its influence. This is it. This is our only safe harbor. This room represents the length and breadth of the war. ([Location 504](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHHQRM2&location=504))
- "When that happens, when you make 'eye contact', it kills you. It kills you and it kills anybody who thinks like you. Physical distance doesn't matter, it's about mental proximity. Anybody with the same ideas, anybody in the same head space. It kills your collaborators, your whole research team. It kills your parents; it kills your children. You become absent humans, human-shaped shells surrounding holes in reality. And when it's done, your project is a hole in the ground, and nobody knows what SCP-3125 is anymore. It is a black hole in antimemetic science, consuming unwary researchers and yielding no information, only detectable through indirect observation. A true description of what SCP-3125 is, or even an allusion to what it is, constitutes a containment breach and a lethal indirect cognitohazard. ([Location 515](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHHQRM2&location=515))
- "There's no war. We've lost the war. It's over. This is the mopping-up operation. The only reason we still exist at all is because we have better amnestic biochemistry than anybody else in the world. Because that's all you can do when you see SCP-3125: run away and try to forget what you saw... seek oblivion in chemicals, or alcohol, or head trauma. And even that can't work every time. It's circling in. We meet it over and over again and we don't realise it. There's no way we can stop ourselves from rediscovering it! We're too damned smart!" ([Location 542](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHHQRM2&location=542))
- "Ideas can be killed," she says, stepping into the airlock. "How?" "With better ideas." ([Location 668](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHHQRM2&location=668))
- If something can cross over from conceptual space into reality, taking physical form, then something can cross in the opposite direction. It must be possible to take a physical entity, mechanically extract the idea which it embodies, amplify that idea and broadcast it up into conceptual space. A bigger idea. A better idea, one designed specifically to fight SCP-3125. ([Location 670](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHHQRM2&location=670))
