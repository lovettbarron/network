## Highlights
- neurons that fire together wire together. Known as Hebb’s Law, ([Location 385](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00IBZ405W&location=385))
- Extra repetition is known as overlearning, and it doesn’t help long-term memory at all. ([Location 540](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00IBZ405W&location=540))
- An accurate accent is powerful because it is the ultimate gesture of empathy. ([Location 1160](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00IBZ405W&location=1160))
- Back-chaining is, incidentally, the cheat code for tongue twisters. ([Location 1251](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00IBZ405W&location=1251))
- While your tongue can’t handle eight new movements at once, it can handle a single new combination of two familiar sounds. If you split long, difficult words into small, easy chunks, you’ll find that your tongue is capable of remarkable acrobatic feats.
