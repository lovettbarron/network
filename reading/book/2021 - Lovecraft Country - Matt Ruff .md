## Highlights
- “But stories are like people, Atticus. Loving them doesn’t make them perfect. You try to cherish their virtues and overlook their flaws. The flaws are still there, though.” ([Location 494](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UG61LNS&location=494))
- White people in his experience were far more transparent. The most hateful rarely bothered to conceal their hostility, and when for some reason they did try to hide their feelings, they generally exhibited all the guile of five-year-olds, who cannot imagine that the world sees them other than as they wish to be seen. ([Location 801](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UG61LNS&location=801))
- “I’m way ahead of you,” Atticus said, crouching down. The lowest shelf was Lovecraft Country: Algernon Blackwood, Robert Bloch, August Derleth, William Hope Hodgson, Frank Belknap Long, Clark Ashton Smith, and the man himself. Finger-walking over the book spines, Atticus stopped at a red leather-bound volume that stuck out conspicuously from between The House on the Borderland and Beyond the Wall of Sleep. ([Location 1382](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UG61LNS&location=1382))
- Observing each man in turn, Atticus tried to deduce which if any of them had real magic powers; but evidently sorcerers, like Communists, were hard to identify by sight. ([Location 1556](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UG61LNS&location=1556))
- “You require me,” Atticus said. “To be your magic Negro?” ([Location 1751](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UG61LNS&location=1751))
- Orithyia Blue, graduate of the Howard Astrotechnical College class of 2001 and the solar system’s best troubleshooter, zipped from planet to planet in her trusty Buick Spacewagon. ([Location 3245](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UG61LNS&location=3245))
- A wanderer in darkness, she followed an eccentric orbit, each new disturbance angling her closer to some long-awaited rendezvous. She could only hope that when the moment came, she’d be wise enough to know it, and brave enough to act. ([Location 3426](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00UG61LNS&location=3426))
