## Highlights
- The goal is not to grab attention, but to help your users accomplish their tasks. The experience you’re creating isn’t permanent—it changes each time the team makes an update. ([Location 184](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082J3Z8R1&location=184))
- A writing mindset asks: How many words will fit here? How should I describe this action? What terms are we using elsewhere? • A design mindset asks: What terms are our users familiar with? What happens next? What problem are we really trying to solve? ([Location 289](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082J3Z8R1&location=289))
- Design experiences that are accessible to everyone include different literacy levels, cultural backgrounds, and disabilities. Usable writing works for all your users, no matter who they are. ([Location 330](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082J3Z8R1&location=330))
- Irresponsible writing weaponizes language to cause harm to your users. ([Location 355](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082J3Z8R1&location=355))
- What does it mean to design something by writing? It means that your words are building someone’s experience. ([Location 376](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B082J3Z8R1&location=376))
