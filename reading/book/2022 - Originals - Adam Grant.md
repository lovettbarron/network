## Highlights
- The starting point is curiosity: pondering why the default exists in the first place. We’re driven to question defaults when we experience vuja de, the opposite of déjà vu. Déjà vu occurs when we encounter something new, but it feels as if we’ve seen it before. Vuja de is the reverse—we face something familiar, but we see it with a fresh perspective that enables us to gain new insights into old problems.

- intuition operates rapidly, based on hot emotions, whereas reason is a slower, cooler process. ([Location 1002](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00XIYGCDO&location=1002))
- “The way to come to power is not always to merely challenge the Establishment, but first make a place in it and then challenge and double-cross the Establishment.” ([Location 1164](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00XIYGCDO&location=1164))
- Unbridled optimism comes across as salesmanship; it seems dishonest somehow, and as a consequence it’s met with skepticism. Everyone is allergic to the feeling, or suspicious of being sold.” ([Location 1216](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00XIYGCDO&location=1216))
    - Note: for julia
- our best allies aren’t the people who have supported us all along. They’re the ones who started out against us and then came around to our side. ([Location 2088](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00XIYGCDO&location=2088))
