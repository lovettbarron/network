## Highlights
- Want to extend the fat-burning half-life of caffeine? Naringenin, a useful little molecule in grapefruit juice, does just the trick. ([Location 264](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003EI2EH2&location=264))
- Overfat? Try timed protein and pre-meal lemon juice. Undermuscled? Try ginger and sauerkraut. ([Location 310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003EI2EH2&location=310))
- To remove stored fat → do the least necessary to trigger a fat-loss cascade of specific hormones. To add muscle in small or large quantities → do the least necessary to trigger local (specific muscles) and systemic (hormonal2) growth mechanisms. ([Location 521](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003EI2EH2&location=521))
- 200 mg of allicin extract before bed ([Location 541](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003EI2EH2&location=541))
- Even if you have 100+ pounds to lose, start with 20. On a 1–10 attractiveness scale, 20 pounds appears to be the critical threshold for going from a 6 to a 9 or 10, at least as tested with male perception of females. The term “recomposition” is important. It does not mean a 20-pound reduction in weight. It’s a 20-pound change in appearance. A 20-pound “recomp” could entail losing 20 pounds of fat or gaining 20 pounds of muscle, but it most often involves losing 15 pounds of fat and gaining 5 pounds of muscle, or some blend in between.

- 10:00 A.M.—Breakfast 2:00 P.M.—Lunch 6:30 P.M.—Smaller second lunch 8:00–9:00 P.M.—Recreation or sports training, if scheduled. 10:00 P.M.—Dinner 12:00 A.M.—Glass of red wine and Discovery Channel before bed Here are some of my meals that recur again and again: • Breakfast (home): Scrambled Eggology® pourable egg whites with one whole egg, black beans, and mixed vegetables warmed up or cooked in a microwave using Pyrex® containers. • Lunch (Mexican restaurant): Grass-fed organic beef, pinto beans, mixed vegetables, and extra guacamole. • Dinner (home): Grass-fed organic beef (from Trader Joe’s), lentils, and mixed vegetables.

- If that’s not enough, don’t forget sugar-free Jell-O. When you are on the verge of self-control breakdown, usually late at night, a few bites will put the demons back in their cages. ([Location 1582](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003EI2EH2&location=1582))
- PRINCIPLE #1: MINIMIZE THE RELEASE OF INSULIN, A STORAGE HORMONE. Insulin release is minimized by blunting sharp jumps in blood sugar: 1. Ensure that your first meal of the day is not a binge meal. Make it high in protein (at least 30 grams) and insoluble fiber (legumes will handle this). The protein will decrease your appetite for the remainder of the binge and prevent total self-destruction. The fiber will be important later to prevent diarrhea. In total, this can be a smallish meal of 300–500 calories.

- naringin in grapefruit juice with coffee, as it extends the effects of caffeine. ([Location 2067](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003EI2EH2&location=2067))
- Policosanol: 20–25 mg Alpha-lipoic acid: 100–300 mg (I take 300 mg with each meal, but some people experience acid reflux symptoms with even 100 mg) Green tea flavanols (decaffeinated with at least 325 mg EGCG): 325 mg G ([Location 2268](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003EI2EH2&location=2268))
