## Highlights
- He was already thinking about the videos he was going to make to teach his baby about calculus when he climaxed. ([Location 1409](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LZWV8JO&location=1409))
- small victory for robotdom by putting her flock to work getting the surviving Luks squared away. ([Location 1705](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LZWV8JO&location=1705))
- “We are just proceeding adaptively to leverage our core competencies.” ([Location 1929](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LZWV8JO&location=1929))
- One of the few appealing things about him was that he had figured out that his personality was a problem and, in classic “get it done” style, had hired a coach to make him less of an asshole. She could see that working in his face. ([Location 2299](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LZWV8JO&location=2299))
- But try explaining to a grizzled cosmonaut why being disruptive was a good thing. ([Location 2723](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00LZWV8JO&location=2723))
