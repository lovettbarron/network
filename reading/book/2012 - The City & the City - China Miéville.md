## Highlights
- “Yeah but. The closest crosshatching is hundreds of metres away. They couldn’t have …” It would have been an extraordinary risk on the part of the murderer or murderers. “I reckon we can assume,” she said. ([Location 281](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001NLKYQ0&location=281))
- Always the question of how to get through the city. ([Location 825](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001NLKYQ0&location=825))
- Then the vehicles with their stamped permissions-to-cross emerged at the opposite end from where they entered, and drove into a foreign city. Often they doubled back, on the crosshatched streets in the Old Town or the Old Town, to the same space they had minutes earlier occupied, though in a new juridic realm. If someone needed to go to a house physically next door to their own but in the neighbouring city, it was in a different road in an unfriendly power. That is what foreigners rarely understand. A Besź dweller cannot walk a few paces next door into an alter house without breach. But pass through Copula Hall and she or he might leave Besźel, and at the end of the hall come back to exactly (corporeally) where they had just been, but in another country, a tourist, a marvelling visitor, to a street that shared the latitude-longitude of their own address, a street they had never visited before, whose architecture they had always unseen, to the Ul Qoman house sitting next to and a whole city away from their own building, unvisible there now they had come through, all the way across the Breach, back home. Copula Hall like the waist of an hourglass, the point of ingress and egress, the navel between the cities. The whole edifice a funnel, letting visitors from one city into the other, and the other into the one. ([Location 1321](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001NLKYQ0&location=1321))
- “I was young. It was a conference. ‘Policing Split Cities.’ They had sessions on Budapest and Jerusalem and Berlin, and Besźel and Ul Qoma.” ([Location 1381](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001NLKYQ0&location=1381))
- Schrödinger’s pedestrian. ([Location 5472](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001NLKYQ0&location=5472))
