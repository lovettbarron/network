## Highlights
- “After decades of working in the field, I am convinced that the definition of design is the skill to bring people and things together. Good design is devising smart connections,” he says. “Connecting people and things means coming up with a unique approach each time. Maintaining the flexibility to respond to every project with a fresh strategy requires a supple thought process, rather than a single signature style. The essence of design can never be about expressing your personality.” ([Location 98](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B8QRL1Q2&location=98))
- Artisans became apprentices at twelve, trained for a decade, and dedicated the rest of their lives to perfecting their craft. ([Location 116](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B8QRL1Q2&location=116))
- Nor was there a word for “garbage” or “trash” during the Edo period, because literally nothing was ever thrown away. Instead, things were constantly reused and repurposed. ([Location 124](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B8QRL1Q2&location=124))
