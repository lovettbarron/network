## Highlights
- In the industry (and this book), most seam allowances are 1/2”. Exceptions apply to necklines, collars, decorative detailing and the use of facings. Their curved or complex shape requires the use of 1/4” seam allowance. ([Location 416](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07JBMP78J&location=416))
- The simple way to look at determining your seam allowance is this: if it holds a garment together, it is 1/2”, if it does not hold a garment together, it is 1/4”. ([Location 419](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07JBMP78J&location=419))
- Seam allowance notches are also needed to aid the user with sewing construction. These notches are generally used to indicate the order of construction. ([Location 443](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07JBMP78J&location=443))
- Drillholes are used to define darts, tucks, pockets and buttons. Drillholes are indicated by a red dot and a red circle on patterns. To mark a dart with a drillhole for sewing, measure to the inside of the dart end or “vanishing point” and down 1/2” (1.3cm) in the center. This amount is universal for both full-scale and half-scale sewing. ([Location 464](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07JBMP78J&location=464))
