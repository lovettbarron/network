## Highlights
- you’re strictly a long-range backpack hunter who humps into the Brooks Range, get a spotting scope that weighs around 2 or 3 pounds with an objective lens not greater than 60 mm and variable magnification of approximately 10×–30×. ([Location 581](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00Q1IFKOG&location=581))
- Learn how the animals in your chosen hunting area are using the habitat to get what they need, and you’ll quickly become a better hunter. ([Location 1841](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00Q1IFKOG&location=1841))
- (Hint: Any instructional material by Will Primos is going to be excellent.) Great callers listen and practice year-round, even keeping a few calls on the dashboard of their car or truck so that windshield time equals practice time.

- In some cases, an hour-long uphill climb is all that it takes to prevent vehicle-based hunters from visiting an area. Typically these guys will stay within a mile or so of their vehicle, and they’ll almost never stray more than 3 miles away. In the rare instance that a vehicle-based hunter does walk more than 3 miles, he usually won’t reach the farthest point of his wandering until the midday period, when hunting conditions are at their worst. ([Location 2532](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00Q1IFKOG&location=2532))
- Deer-sized animals, once they’re boned out, can usually be transported in a single (though sometimes grueling) load. Other animals, such as moose, might require a hunter to make six or seven trips while carrying 100-pound loads.
