## Highlights
- To really listen is to be moved physically, chemically, emotionally, and intellectually by another person’s narrative. ([Location 38](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07RYGHKND&location=38))
- People describe me as the type of person who can talk to anyone, but it’s really that I can listen to anyone. It’s worked for me as a journalist. ([Location 81](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07RYGHKND&location=81))
- The ability to listen to anyone has been replaced by the capacity to shut out everyone, particularly those who disagree with us or don’t get to the point fast enough. ([Location 112](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07RYGHKND&location=112))
