## Highlights
- Happiness consists in getting enough sleep. Just that, nothing more. ([Location 849](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004EYTK2C&location=849))
- War is not violence and killing, pure and simple; war is controlled violence, for a purpose. The purpose of war is to support your government’s decisions by force. The purpose is never to kill the enemy just to be killing him . . . but to make him do what you want him to do. Not killing . . . but controlled and purposeful violence. ([Location 1002](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004EYTK2C&location=1002))
- “Hendrick, I have explained these matters to you because it is useless to punish a man unless he knows why he is being punished. ([Location 1115](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004EYTK2C&location=1115))
- The best things in life are beyond money; their price is agony and sweat and devotion . . . and the price demanded for the most precious of all things in life is life itself—ultimate cost for perfect value.” ([Location 1475](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004EYTK2C&location=1475))
- “But—good heavens!” the girl answered. “I didn’t like being spanked any more than any kid does, but when I needed it, my mama delivered. The only time I ever got a switching in school I got another one when I got home—and that was years and years ago. I don’t ever expect to be hauled up in front of a judge and sentenced to a flogging; you behave yourself and such things don’t happen. I don’t see anything wrong with our system; it’s a lot better than not being able to walk outdoors for fear of your life—why, that’s horrible!” ([Location 1807](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004EYTK2C&location=1807))
- Liberty is never unalienable; it must be redeemed regularly with the blood of patriots or it always vanishes. Of all the so-called natural human rights that have ever been invented, liberty is least likely to be cheap and is never free of cost. ([Location 1844](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004EYTK2C&location=1844))
- the ‘pursuit of happiness’? It is indeed unalienable but it is not a right; it is simply a universal condition which tyrants cannot take away nor patriots restore. ([Location 1847](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004EYTK2C&location=1847))
- their citizens (all of them counted as such) glorified their mythology of ‘rights’ . . . and lost track of their duties. No nation, so constituted, can endure.” ([Location 1855](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004EYTK2C&location=1855))
- Girls are simply wonderful. Just to stand on a corner and watch them going past is delightful. They don’t walk. At least not what we do when we talk. I don’t know how to describe it, but it’s much more complex and utterly delightful. They don’t move just their feet; everything moves and in different directions . . . and all of it graceful. ([Location 1916](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004EYTK2C&location=1916))
- Under our system every voter and officeholder is a man who has demonstrated through voluntary and difficult service that he places the welfare of the group ahead of personal advantage. ([Location 2773](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004EYTK2C&location=2773))
- “Sir, revolution is impossible.” “Yes. But why?” “Because revolution—armed uprising—requires not only dissatisfaction but aggressiveness. A revolutionist has to be willing to fight and die—or he’s just a parlor pink. If you separate out the aggressive ones and make them the sheep dogs, the sheep will never give you trouble.” “Nicely put! ([Location 2798](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004EYTK2C&location=2798))
- But you can’t buy fighting spirit. It’s scarce. We use all of it, waste none. The M.I. is the smallest army in history for the size of the population it guards. You can’t buy an M.I., you can’t conscript him, you can’t coerce him—you can’t even keep him if he wants to leave. He can quit thirty seconds before a drop, lose his nerve and not get into his capsule and all that happens is that he is paid off and can never vote.
