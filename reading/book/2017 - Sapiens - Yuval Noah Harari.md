## Highlights
- There were humans long before there was history. ([Location 102](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=102))
- Just 6 million years ago, a single female ape had two daughters. One became the ancestor of all chimpanzees, the other is our own grandmother. ([Location 127](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=127))
- The appearance of new ways of thinking and communicating, between 70,000 and 30,000 years ago, constitutes the Cognitive Revolution. ([Location 368](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=368))
- The gossip theory might sound like a joke, but numerous studies support it. Even today the vast majority of human communication – whether in the form of emails, phone calls or newspaper columns – is gossip. It comes so naturally to us that it seems as if our language evolved for this very purpose. ([Location 404](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=404))
- Gossip usually focuses on wrongdoings. Rumour-mongers are the original fourth estate, journalists who inform society about and thus protect it from cheats and freeloaders. ([Location 409](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=409))
- Yet the truly unique feature of our language is not its ability to transmit information about men and lions. Rather, it’s the ability to transmit information about things that do not exist at all. ([Location 411](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=411))
- And if you spend hours praying to non-existing guardian spirits, aren’t you wasting precious time, time better spent foraging, fighting and fornicating? But fiction has enabled us not merely to imagine things, but to do so collectively. We can weave common myths such as the biblical creation story, the Dreamtime myths of Aboriginal Australians, and the nationalist myths of modern states. Such myths give Sapiens the unprecedented ability to cooperate flexibly in large numbers. ([Location 420](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=420))
- The alpha male usually wins his position not because he is physically stronger, but because he leads a large and stable coalition. ([Location 437](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=437))
- In the wake of the Cognitive Revolution, gossip helped Homo sapiens to form larger and more stable bands. But even gossip has its limits. Sociological research has shown that the maximum ‘natural’ size of a group bonded by gossip is about 150 individuals. Most people can neither intimately know, nor gossip effectively about, more than 150 human beings. ([Location 452](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=452))
- once the threshold of 150 individuals is crossed, things can no longer work that way. ([Location 461](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=461))
- The secret was probably the appearance of fiction. Large numbers of strangers can cooperate successfully by believing in common myths. ([Location 465](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=465))
- There are no gods in the universe, no nations, no money, no human rights, no laws, and no justice outside the common imagination of human beings. ([Location 473](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=473))
- Modern business-people and lawyers are, in fact, powerful sorcerers. The principal difference between them and tribal shamans is that modern lawyers tell far stranger tales. ([Location 477](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=477))
- People were afraid to start new businesses and take economic risks. It hardly seemed worth taking the chance that their families could end up utterly destitute. This is why people began collectively to imagine the existence of limited liability companies. ([Location 507](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=507))
- In the case of Peugeot SA the crucial story was the French legal code, as written by the French parliament. According to the French legislators, if a certified lawyer followed all the proper liturgy and rituals, wrote all the required spells and oaths on a wonderfully decorated piece of paper, and affixed his ornate signature to the bottom of the document, then hocus pocus – a new company was incorporated. ([Location 526](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=526))
- Telling effective stories is not easy. The difficulty lies not in telling the story, but in convincing everyone else to believe it. Much of history revolves around this question: how does one convince millions of people to believe particular stories about gods, or nations, or limited liability companies? Yet when it succeeds, it gives Sapiens immense power, because it enables millions of strangers to cooperate and work towards common goals. ([Location 531](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=531))
- Unlike lying, an imagined reality is something that everyone believes in, and as long as this communal belief persists, the imagined reality exerts force in the world. ([Location 542](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=542))
- Some sorcerers are charlatans, but most sincerely believe in the existence of gods and demons. ([Location 544](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=544))
- Ever since the Cognitive Revolution, Sapiens have thus been living in a dual reality. On the one hand, the objective reality of rivers, trees and lions; and on the other hand, the imagined reality of gods, nations and corporations. As time went by, the imagined reality became ever more powerful, so that today the very survival of rivers, trees and lions depends on the grace of imagined entities such as the United States and Google. ([Location 548](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=548))
- contrast, ever since the Cognitive Revolution, Sapiens have been able to change their behaviour quickly, transmitting new behaviours to future generations without any need of genetic or environmental change. As a prime example, consider the repeated appearance of childless elites, such as the Catholic priesthood, Buddhist monastic orders and Chinese eunuch bureaucracies. ([Location 571](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=571))
- The Cognitive Revolution is accordingly the point when history declared its independence from biology. ([Location 633](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=633))
- To understand the rise of Christianity or the French Revolution, it is not enough to comprehend the interaction of genes, hormones and organisms. It is necessary to take into account the interaction of ideas, images and fantasies as well. ([Location 636](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=636))
- The real difference between us and chimpanzees is the mythical glue that binds together large numbers of individuals, families and groups. This glue has made us the masters of creation. ([Location 647](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=647))
- Ever since the Cognitive Revolution, there hasn’t been a single natural way of life for Sapiens. There are only cultural choices, from among a bewildering palette of possibilities. ([Location 763](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=763))
- foragers regularly ate dozens of different foodstuffs. The peasant’s ancient ancestor, the forager, may have eaten berries and mushrooms for breakfast; fruits, snails and turtle for lunch; and rabbit steak with wild onions for dinner. Tomorrow’s menu might have been completely different. This variety ensured that the ancient foragers received all the necessary nutrients. ([Location 860](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=860))
- failed. Agricultural societies are ravaged by famine when drought, fire or earthquake devastates the annual rice or potato crop. Forager societies were hardly immune to natural disasters, and suffered from periods of want and hunger, but they were usually able to deal with such calamities more easily. ([Location 864](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=864))
- The truth is that Aché society, like every human society, was very complex. We should beware of demonising or idealising it on the basis of a superficial acquaintance. The Aché were neither angels nor fiends – they were humans. So, too, were the ancient hunter-gatherers. ([Location 896](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=896))
- mass extinctions akin to the archetypal Australian decimation occurred again and again in the ensuing millennia – whenever people settled another part of the Outer World. ([Location 1096](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=1096))
- Hunter-gatherers spent their time in more stimulating and varied ways, and were less in danger of starvation and disease. The Agricultural Revolution certainly enlarged the sum total of food at the disposal of humankind, but the extra food did not translate into a better diet or more leisure. Rather, it translated into population explosions and pampered elites. The average farmer worked harder than the average forager, and got a worse diet in return. The Agricultural Revolution was history’s biggest fraud.2 ([Location 1279](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=1279))
- We did not domesticate wheat. It domesticated us. The word ‘domesticate’ comes from the Latin domus, which means ‘house’. Who’s the one living in a house? Not the wheat. It’s the Sapiens. ([Location 1302](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=1302))
- The currency of evolution is neither hunger nor pain, but rather copies of DNA helixes. Just as the economic success of a company is measured only by the number of dollars in its bank account, not by the happiness of its employees, so the evolutionary success of a species is measured by the number of copies of its DNA. If no more DNA copies remain, the species is extinct, just as a company without money is bankrupt. If a species boasts many DNA copies, it is a success, and the species flourishes. ([Location 1340](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=1340))
- This is the essence of the Agricultural Revolution: the ability to keep more people alive under worse conditions. ([Location 1344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ICN066A&location=1344))
