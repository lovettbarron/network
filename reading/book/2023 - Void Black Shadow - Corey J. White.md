## Highlights
- You see politics where the rest of us see survival.” “Everything is politics.” ([Location 1243](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0756JCH2F&location=1243))
- On Homan these people are abusers, torturers, and murderers, but down here? They’re just boring fucking assholes, with a job, maybe a family, and either no conscience or a convenient series of lies they tell themselves to get through the day. I didn’t want to think that evil could be so boring, so normal, but here it is, laid out in front of me. ([Location 1608](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0756JCH2F&location=1608))
