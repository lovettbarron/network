## Highlights
- Maybe it’s a cliché, but you have to focus on verbs over nouns—what you want to do, not what you want to be. ([Location 148](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08CTG5NPS&location=148))
- At the core of any creative act is an impulse to make manifest our powerful desire to connect—with others, with ourselves, with the sacred, with God? We all want to feel less alone, and I believe that a song being sung is one of the clearest views we ever have to witness how humans reach out for warmth with our art. ([Location 164](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08CTG5NPS&location=164))
- I think it’s the coolest thing in the world when someone steps outside their so-called station in life to indulge in a personal “art for the sake of art” moment. If we’re being realistic about what an end goal should be, creating something with no ambition other than to get something off our chest might be the purest thing anyone could aim for. ([Location 187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08CTG5NPS&location=187))
- Knowing how to write a song isn’t going to help you much if you never find the inspiration or discipline to get started. ([Location 199](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08CTG5NPS&location=199))
- inspiration is rarely the first step. When it does come out of the blue, it’s glorious. But it’s much more in your own hands than the divine-intervention-type beliefs we all tend to have about inspiration. Most of the time, inspiration has to be invited. ([Location 212](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08CTG5NPS&location=212))
- You need your human frailty to be at least somewhat visible if you want to connect on an emotional level—if you want things to feel real. ([Location 227](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08CTG5NPS&location=227))
- learning how to disappear is the best way I’ve found to make my true self visible to myself and others. ([Location 235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08CTG5NPS&location=235))
- I’m convinced the dreams we have for ourselves go unattained from a lack of permission more than any deficit in talent or desire. ([Location 268](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08CTG5NPS&location=268))
- I want to give you tough love. If you think you want to write songs but you can’t find time to do something as pleasurable and lovely as making up a song, then it’s just an idea you want to have of yourself as a person who writes songs, but you’ve found other things that are more important to you.
