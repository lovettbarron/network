## Highlights
- This study had no characters, no plot, and no story. ([Location 14](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Q3GVMMK&location=14))
- Stories starring a customer (and not the CEO) have a way of eliciting what ethnographers call the “emic” position, or what business people would call customer obsession. Isn’t it odd, then, that we don’t use this universal way of sharing knowledge when we share knowledge about customers? ([Location 19](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Q3GVMMK&location=19))
- Scale and causation are appropriately quantitative in nature. Yet—as I learned listening to that presentation on Chinese innovation—it takes an extraordinary amount of work for a human to make sense of quant data. ([Location 35](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Q3GVMMK&location=35))
- Quantitative researchers focus on scale on causation but fail to provide coherence and participant focus. Qualitative research, by contrast, focuses on coherence and participant focus but lacks scale and causation. ([Location 38](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Q3GVMMK&location=38))
- When we use quant data, we put the sensemaking onus on the consumer of the research, and when we use qual data, we sacrifice scale and causation. This is a terrible trade-off. ([Location 40](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Q3GVMMK&location=40))
- Anecdotes lack method. They are not collected in any particular way, ([Location 58](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07Q3GVMMK&location=58))
