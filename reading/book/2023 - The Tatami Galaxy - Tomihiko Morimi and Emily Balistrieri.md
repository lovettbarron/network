## Highlights
- “You’re still young,” some would say. “It’s never too late to change.” Are you fucking kidding me? They say that the soul of a child at three remains the same even when the man reaches a hundred. So what good can it do for a splendid young man of twenty-one, nearly a quarter century old, to put a lot of sloppy effort into transforming his character? ([Location 376](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09V311XVY&location=376))
- I must shoulder the burden of my current self for the rest of my life. I mustn’t avert my eyes from that reality. ([Location 381](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09V311XVY&location=381))
- I can’t look away, but it’s just so hard to watch. ([Location 382](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09V311XVY&location=382))
- Despite being registered in the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, he hated electricity, electronics, and engineering. ([Location 398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09V311XVY&location=398))
- I had modestly kept my good sense and talents hidden so no one would find them, but I did such a good job that I hadn’t been able to locate them myself for the past few years; for her to spot them within five minutes of our meeting meant she couldn’t be any ordinary fortune-teller.

- Spring had come again, and my annoyance had reached new heights. Jogasaki stubbornly remained in charge, showing not even the slightest intent to retire. He sucked on his power in this fishbowl society with the energy of a baby sucking a pacifier, his eyes constantly straying to the fresh breasts of the newbies. And the lowerclassmen were charmed by his puny charisma, seemingly intent on wasting their student days that should have been spent so meaningfully. Now was the time for someone to throw a bucket of cold water over their heads. And I was determined to step up and take that unprofitable role.
