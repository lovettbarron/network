## Highlights
- This means, for example, that from the facts that 1 ≡ 8 and 3 ≡ 10 (mod 7) we can deduce that 1+3 = 4 is congruent to 8+10 = 18; and that 1×3 = 3 is congruent to 8×10 = 80. As a check, the differences 14 and 77 are both divisible by 7. ([Location 657](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CWR4MIK&location=657))
- 10 Boolean algebra is of some use in the design of logic circuits for computers (see e.g. Rutherford, Introduction to Lattice Theory, Oliver & Boyd, 1965, pp. 31—40, 58-74). Apart from its connection with set theory it has little relevance to the main body of mathematics. However, quite a deep theory exists. See P. R. Halmos, Lectures on Boolean Algebras, Van Nostrand, 1963. ([Location 5542](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CWR4MIK&location=5542))
