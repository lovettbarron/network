## Highlights
- The beauty of it cannot be understood, either, and when you see beauty in desolation it changes something inside you. Desolation tries to colonize you. ([Location 47](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EGJ32A6&location=47))
- The psychologist might recite the measurements of the “top” of the tower, but those numbers meant nothing, had no wider context. Without context, clinging to those numbers was a form of madness. ([Location 252](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EGJ32A6&location=252))
- There are certain kinds of deaths that one should not be expected to relive, certain kinds of connections so deep that when they are broken you feel the snap of the link inside you. ([Location 554](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EGJ32A6&location=554))
- The map had been the first form of misdirection, for what was a map but a way of emphasizing some things and making other things invisible? ([Location 808](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EGJ32A6&location=808))
- some questions will ruin you if you are denied the answer long enough. ([Location 2077](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EGJ32A6&location=2077))
- That which dies shall still know life in death for all that decays is not forgotten and reanimated shall walk the world in a bliss of not-knowing ([Location 2118](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EGJ32A6&location=2118))
- Our instruments are useless, our methodology broken, our motivations selfish. ([Location 2386](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EGJ32A6&location=2386))
