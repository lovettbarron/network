## Highlights
- "at the heart of an effective creative philosophy is the belief that nothing is so powerful as an insight into human nature, what compulsions drive a man, what instincts dominate his action, even though his language so often camouflages what really motivates him. For if you know these things about [a] man you can touch him at the core of his being." ([Location 72](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SW16FS&location=72))
- The best and most effective advertising is that which sets out to invo/ve consumers, both in its communication and in the process of developing its message. ([Location 74](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SW16FS&location=74))
- The best advertising solutions, almost without exception, represent the combination of skills and ideas from clients, creative people, and consumers alike. A planner representing consumer opinions in the absence of an insightful client and talented creative people is unlikely to make any advertising any better. ([Location 109](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SW16FS&location=109))
- For a start, people choose to experience art, movies, and music, whereas advertising is forced on them. The audience for pure art is self-selecting, but advertising has to find them and draw them in. ([Location 270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SW16FS&location=270))
