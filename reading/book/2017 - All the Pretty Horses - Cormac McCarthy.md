## Highlights
- The boy who rode on slightly before him sat a horse not only as if he’d been born to it which he was but as if were he begot by malice or mischance into some queer land where horses never were he would have found them anyway. ([Location 326](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001L4Z6YO&location=326))
- He lay a long time listening to the others breathing in their sleep while he contemplated the wildness about him, the wildness within. ([Location 891](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001L4Z6YO&location=891))
- Ever dumb thing I ever done in my life there was a decision I made before that got me into it. It was never the dumb thing. It was always some choice I’d made before it. You understand what I’m sayin? ([Location 1183](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001L4Z6YO&location=1183))
- They were attended by a pack of greyhound dogs and the dogs were lean and silver in color and they flowed among the legs of the horses silent and fluid as running mercury and the horses paid them no mind at all. ([Location 1464](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001L4Z6YO&location=1464))
- Lastly he said that he had seen the souls of horses and that it was a terrible thing to see. He said that it could be seen under certain circumstances attending the death of a horse because the horse shares a common soul and its separate life only forms it out of all horses and makes it mortal. ([Location 1669](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001L4Z6YO&location=1669))
- Finally he said that among men there was no such communion as among horses and the notion that men can be understood at all was probably an illusion. ([Location 1673](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001L4Z6YO&location=1673))
