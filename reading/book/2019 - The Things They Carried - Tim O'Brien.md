## Highlights
- To carry something was to hump it, as when Lieutenant Jimmy Cross humped his love for Martha up the hills and through the swamps. In its intransitive form, to hump meant to walk, or to march, but it implied burdens far beyond the intransitive. ([Location 78](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TWIVNA&location=78))
- He carried a strobe light and the responsibility for the lives of his men. ([Location 95](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TWIVNA&location=95))
- They carried all they could bear, and then some, including a silent awe for the terrible power of the things they carried. ([Location 124](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TWIVNA&location=124))
- The things they carried were determined to some extent by superstition. ([Location 184](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TWIVNA&location=184))
- They shared the weight of memory. They took up what others could no longer bear. Often, they carried each other, the wounded or weak. ([Location 202](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TWIVNA&location=202))
- They carried the land itself—Vietnam, the place, the soil—a powdery orange-red dust that covered their boots and fatigues and faces. They carried the sky. The whole atmosphere, they carried it, the humidity, the monsoons, the stink of fungus and decay, all of it, they carried gravity. They moved like mules. By daylight they took sniper fire, at night they were mortared, but it was not battle, it was just the endless march, village to village, without purpose, nothing won or lost. They marched for the sake of the march. They plodded along slowly, dumbly, leaning forward against the heat, unthinking, all blood and bone, simple grunts, soldiering with their legs, toiling up the hills and down into the paddies and across the rivers and up again and down, just humping, one step and then the next and then another, but no volition, no will, because it was automatic, it was anatomy, and the war was entirely a matter of posture and carriage, the hump was everything, a kind of inertia, a kind of emptiness, a dullness of desire and intellect and conscience and hope and human sensibility. ([Location 205](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TWIVNA&location=205))
- for all the ambiguities of Vietnam, all the mysteries and unknowns, there was at least the single abiding certainty that they would never be at a loss for things to carry. ([Location 221](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TWIVNA&location=221))
- It was the burden of being alive. Awkwardly, the men would reassemble themselves, first in private, then in groups, becoming soldiers again. ([Location 259](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TWIVNA&location=259))
- They were afraid of dying but they were even more afraid to show it. ([Location 267](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TWIVNA&location=267))
- They carried the soldier’s greatest fear, which was the fear of blushing. Men killed, and died, because they were embarrassed not to. It was what had brought them to the war in the first place, nothing positive, no dreams of glory or honor, just to avoid the blush of dishonor. They died so as not to die of embarrassment. ([Location 283](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TWIVNA&location=283))
- Boom-down, and you were dead, never partly dead. ([Location 323](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TWIVNA&location=323))
- The bad stuff never stops happening: it lives in its own dimension, replaying itself over and over. But the war wasn’t all that way. ([Location 391](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TWIVNA&location=391))
- As a writer, all you can do is pick a street and go for the ride, putting things down as they come at you. That’s the real obsession. All those stories. ([Location 414](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TWIVNA&location=414))
- That’s what stories are for. Stories are for joining the past to the future. Stories are for those late hours in the night when you can’t remember how you got from where you were to where you are. Stories are for eternity, when memory is erased, when there is nothing to remember except the story. ([Location 445](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TWIVNA&location=445))
- Courage, I seemed to think, comes to us in finite quantities, like an inheritance, and by being frugal and stashing it away and letting it earn interest, we steadily increase our moral capital in preparation for that day when the account must be drawn down. It was a comforting theory. It dispensed with all those bothersome little acts of daily courage; it offered hope and grace to the repetitive coward; it justified the past while amortizing the future. ([Location 455](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TWIVNA&location=455))
- If you support a war, if you think it’s worth the price, that’s fine, but you have to put your own precious fluids on the line. ([Location 482](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TWIVNA&location=482))
- During that long summer I’d been over and over the various arguments, all the pros and cons, and it was no longer a question that could be decided by an act of pure reason. Intellect had come up against emotion. My conscience told me to run, but some irrational and powerful force was resisting, like a weight pushing me toward the war. What it came down to, stupidly, was a sense of shame. Hot, stupid shame. ([Location 596](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TWIVNA&location=596))
- I would go to the war—I would kill and maybe die—because I was embarrassed not to. ([Location 694](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TWIVNA&location=694))
- I survived, but it’s not a happy ending. I was a coward. I went to the war. ([Location 708](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TWIVNA&location=708))
- A true war story is never moral. It does not instruct, nor encourage virtue, nor suggest models of proper human behavior, nor restrain men from doing the things men have always done. ([Location 767](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TWIVNA&location=767))
- If at the end of a war story you feel uplifted, or if you feel that some small bit of rectitude has been salvaged from the larger waste, then you have been made the victim of a very old and terrible lie. There is no rectitude whatsoever. There is no virtue. As a first rule of thumb, therefore, you can tell a true war story by its absolute and uncompromising allegiance to obscenity and evil. ([Location 769](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TWIVNA&location=769))
- War is hell, but that’s not the half of it, because war is also mystery and terror and adventure and courage and discovery and holiness and pity and despair and longing and love. War is nasty; war is fun. War is thrilling; war is drudgery. War makes you a man; war makes you dead. ([Location 906](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TWIVNA&location=906))
- a true war story is never about war. It’s about sunlight. It’s about the special way that dawn spreads out on a river when you know you must cross the river and march into the mountains and do things you are afraid to do. It’s about love and memory. It’s about sorrow. It’s about sisters who never write back and people who never listen. ([Location 966](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TWIVNA&location=966))
- It wasn’t a question of deceit. Just the opposite: he wanted to heat up the truth, to make it burn so hot that you would feel exactly what he felt. For Rat Kiley, I think, facts were formed by sensation, not the other way around, and when you listened to one of his stories, you’d find yourself performing rapid calculations in your head, subtracting superlatives, figuring the square root of an absolute and then multiplying by maybe. ([Location 1002](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TWIVNA&location=1002))
- “Speaking of Courage” was written in 1975 at the suggestion of Norman Bowker, who three years later hanged himself in the locker room of a YMCA in his hometown in central Iowa. In the spring of 1975, near the time of Saigon’s final collapse, I received a long, disjointed letter in which Bowker described the problem of finding a meaningful use for his life after the war. ([Location 1730](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TWIVNA&location=1730))
- In ordinary conversation I never spoke much about the war, certainly not in detail, and yet ever since my return I had been talking about it virtually nonstop through my writing. Telling stories seemed a natural, inevitable process, like clearing the throat. Partly catharsis, partly communication, it was a way of grabbing people by the shirt and explaining exactly what had happened to me, how I’d allowed myself to get dragged into a wrong war, all the mistakes I’d made, all the terrible things I had seen and done. ([Location 1761](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TWIVNA&location=1761))
- I did not look on my work as therapy, and still don’t. Yet when I received Norman Bowker’s letter, it occurred to me that the act of writing had led me through a swirl of memories that might otherwise have ended in paralysis or worse. By telling stories, you objectify your own experience. You separate it from yourself. You pin down certain truths. You make up others. You start sometimes with an incident that truly happened, like the night in the shit field, and you carry it forward by inventing incidents that did not in fact occur but that nonetheless help to clarify and explain. ([Location 1764](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TWIVNA&location=1764))
- But listen. Even that story is made up. I want you to feel what I felt. I want you to know why story-truth is truer sometimes than happening-truth. ([Location 1996](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TWIVNA&location=1996))
- Here is the happening-truth. I was once a soldier. There were many bodies, real bodies with real faces, but I was young then and I was afraid to look. And now, twenty years later, I’m left with faceless responsibility and faceless grief. Here is the story-truth. He was a slim, dead, almost dainty young man of about twenty. ([Location 1998](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TWIVNA&location=1998))
- “Daddy, tell the truth,” Kathleen can say, “did you ever kill anybody?” And I can say, honestly, “Of course not.” Or I can say, honestly, “Yes.” ([Location 2003](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TWIVNA&location=2003))
- The hours go by and you lose your gyroscope; your mind starts to roam. You think about dark closets, madmen, murderers under the bed, all those childhood fears. Gremlins and trolls and giants. You try to block it out but you can’t. You see ghosts. You blink and shake your head. Bullshit, you tell yourself. But then you remember the guys who died: Curt Lemon, Kiowa, Ted Lavender, a half-dozen others whose faces you can’t bring into focus anymore. And then pretty soon you start to ponder the stories you’ve heard about Charlie’s magic. The time some guys cornered two VC in a dead-end tunnel, no way out, but how, when the tunnel was fragged and searched, nothing was found except a pile of dead rats. A hundred stories. Ghosts wiping out a whole squad of Marines in twenty seconds flat. Ghosts rising from the dead. Ghosts behind you and in front of you and inside you. After a while, as the night deepens, you feel a funny buzzing in your ears. Tiny sounds get heightened and distorted. The crickets talk in code; the night takes on an electronic tingle. You hold your breath. ([Location 2274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TWIVNA&location=2274))
- That’s what a story does. The bodies are animated. You make the dead talk. ([Location 2569](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TWIVNA&location=2569))
- It’s now 1990. I’m forty-three years old, which would’ve seemed impossible to a fourth grader, and yet when I look at photographs of myself as I was in 1956, I realize that in the important ways I haven’t changed at all. I was Timmy then; now I’m Tim. But the essence remains the same. I’m not fooled by the baggy pants or the crew cut or the happy smile—I know my own eyes—and there is no doubt that the Timmy smiling at the camera is the Tim I am now. Inside the body, or beyond the body, there is something absolute and unchanging. The human life is all one thing, like a blade tracing loops on ice: a little kid, a twenty-three-year-old infantry sergeant, a middle-aged writer knowing guilt and sorrow. And as a writer now, I want to save Linda’s life. Not her body—her life. ([Location 2615](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TWIVNA&location=2615))
- In Vietnam, too, we had ways of making the dead seem not quite so dead. Shaking hands, that was one way. By slighting death, by acting, we pretended it was not the terrible thing it was. By our language, which was both hard and wistful, we transformed the bodies into piles of waste. Thus, when someone got killed, as Curt Lemon did, his body was not really a body, but rather one small bit of waste in the midst of a much wider wastage. ([Location 2647](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TWIVNA&location=2647))
- For a few seconds she was quiet. “Well, right now,” she said, “I’m not dead. But when I am, it’s like . . . I don’t know, I guess it’s like being inside a book that nobody’s reading.” “A book?” I said. “An old one. It’s up on a library shelf, so you’re safe and everything, but the book hasn’t been checked out for a long, long time. All you can do is wait. Just hope somebody’ll pick it up and start reading.” Linda smiled at me. “Anyhow, it’s not so bad,” she said. “I mean, when you’re dead, you just have to be yourself.” She stood up and put on her red stocking cap. “This is stupid. Let’s go skate some more.” ([Location 2723](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TWIVNA&location=2723))
- I’m young and happy. I’ll never die. I’m skimming across the surface of my own history, moving fast, riding the melt beneath the blades, doing loops and spins, and when I take a high leap into the dark and come down thirty years later, I realize it is as Tim trying to save Timmy’s life with a story. ([Location 2735](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002TWIVNA&location=2735))
