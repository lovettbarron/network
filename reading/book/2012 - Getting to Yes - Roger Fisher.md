## Highlights
- There is a third way to negotiate, a way neither hard nor soft, but rather both hard and soft. The method of principled negotiation developed at the Harvard Negotiation Project is to decide issues on their merits rather than through a haggling process focused on what each side says it will and won’t do. It suggests that you look for mutual gains whenever possible, and that where your interests conflict, you should insist that the result be based on some fair standards independent of the will of either side. The method of principled negotiation is hard on the merits, soft on the people. It employs no tricks and no posturing. Principled negotiation shows you how to obtain what you are entitled to and still be decent. It enables you to be fair while protecting you against those who would take advantage of your fairness.

- Any method of negotiation may be fairly judged by three criteria: It should produce a wise agreement if agreement is possible. It should be efficient. And it should improve or at least not damage the relationship between the parties. (A wise agreement can be defined as one that meets the legitimate interests of each side to the extent possible, resolves conflicting interests fairly, is durable, and takes community interests into account.) ([Location 210](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003TFDWFI&location=210))
- Being nice is no answer Many people recognize the high costs of hard positional bargaining, particularly on the parties and their relationship. They hope to avoid them by following a more gentle style of negotiation. ([Location 268](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003TFDWFI&location=268))
- Emotions typically become entangled with the objective merits of the problem. Taking positions just makes this worse because people’s egos become identified with their positions. ([Location 309](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003TFDWFI&location=309))
- the first proposition: Separate the people from the problem. ([Location 312](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003TFDWFI&location=312))
- A negotiating position often obscures what you really want. Compromising between positions is not likely to produce an agreement which will effectively take care of the human needs that led people to adopt those positions. The second basic element of the method is: Focus on interests, not positions. ([Location 314](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003TFDWFI&location=314))
- In fact, with many long-term clients, business partners, family members, fellow professionals, government officials, or foreign nations, the ongoing relationship is far more important than the outcome of any particular negotiation. ([Location 406](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003TFDWFI&location=406))
- People tend to see what they want to see. Out of a mass of detailed information, they tend to pick out and focus on those facts that confirm their prior perceptions and to disregard or misinterpret those that call their perceptions into question. Each side in a negotiation may see only the merits of its case, and only the faults of the other side’s. ([Location 459](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003TFDWFI&location=459))
- The ability to see the situation as the other side sees it, as difficult as it may be, is one of the most important skills a negotiator can possess. ([Location 462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003TFDWFI&location=462))
