## Highlights
- Borders are more than mere walls; they take other, more insidious forms. ([Location 391](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D3X2P9Q&location=391))
- We were supposed to have a homeland, somewhere safe from oppression. Not to become the oppressors ourselves. ([Location 488](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D3X2P9Q&location=488))
- Imagine that you are one thing and, at the same time, something other entirely, both trying to coexist at once. That is the condition of being a Jew, I sometimes think—to always be one thing and another, to never quite fit. We are the grains of sand that irritate the oyster shell of the world. ([Location 827](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D3X2P9Q&location=827))
- His mother told him he’d been mumbling all night, in his half sleep, speaking of impossible things: planes crashing into tall buildings, children thrown into ovens, a helmeted man walking on the moon. ([Location 947](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D3X2P9Q&location=947))
- “We keep making the mistake of thinking the sephirot are real,” La Méduse says, a hint of contempt. “We let them trap us.” ([Location 1442](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D3X2P9Q&location=1442))
- Mostly you have learned to control the slippage, though it is harder in Berlin, where many of the homeless that you pass, shivering in shop entrances, have the lost, hollow-eyed look of those who fell between the cracks, who woke up one morning in a world as like, yet so unlike, their own, in which everything that was once familiar had become alien and strange. ([Location 1543](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D3X2P9Q&location=1543))
- “You know, Al-Qaeda and that?” “Is that a band?” ([Location 1555](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D3X2P9Q&location=1555))
- The world is the sum of what it could be, what it might have been and how it could have been. ([Location 2047](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D3X2P9Q&location=2047))
- You see black-clad Unterlanders walking along pavements beside Nandi workers, Jewish girls in light summer dresses imported from Paris and Rome, soldiers in baobab-grey uniforms and black guns. You taste ugali. Your interest is in the hidden denizens of this city, this world. This is a place where the Jews won. ([Location 2126](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D3X2P9Q&location=2126))
- She is a youngish, blonde woman, tall and leggy in white, with the discreet swastika flag on the breast pocket of what must be a nurse’s uniform: and you remember that in this world, things turned out differently. ([Location 2261](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D3X2P9Q&location=2261))
