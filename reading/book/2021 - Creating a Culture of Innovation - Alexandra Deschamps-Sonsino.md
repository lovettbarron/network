## Highlights
- The relentlessness of the 24-hour news cycle means corporations feel obligated to feed it with webinars, incubator launches, and concept videos, just to keep playing a global game of innovation theater. ([Location 52](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08PQJGQLB&location=52))
- It would be too easy to blame “open innovation” for the well-designed interiors that now act like a cargo cult. If you build it, they won’t come, it turns out. As Bill Stumpf (codesigner of the Aeron chair) admitted6 I’m not sure there’s a correlation between a piece of furniture and productivity.

- The best innovation work is also down to personal interest, peer groups, timing, and luck, no matter what the state of the carpet. ([Location 65](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08PQJGQLB&location=65))
- we’ll look at the history of resources given to employees to manipulate them into more effective or creative work. ([Location 81](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08PQJGQLB&location=81))
- From hubs, labs, garages, and beyond, these corporate spaces are not actually work spaces, but spaces dedicated to showing off work the corporation describes as innovative. ([Location 89](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08PQJGQLB&location=89))
- To consider space is not only to consider how that team actually operates but also how it is perceived by the rest of the business. The spatial decisions an innovation manager makes may impact how innovation work is done and how that work makes its way “over the wall” to the rest of the business.
