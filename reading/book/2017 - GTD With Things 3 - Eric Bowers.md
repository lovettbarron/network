## Highlights
- Capture : Collect what has your attention Clarify : Process what it means Organize : Put it where it belongs Reflect : Review frequently Engage : Simply Do ([Location 68](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074D51BB2&location=68))
- Is the item a Project (taking more than one physical, visible step to complete)? Is this something that only takes one step to do? (An Action) Would this be something that I can do right now, in two minutes or less? If so, it’s best to just get it off of your plate now, rather than categorize it, which will likely take a minute or two. Is this something that I might want to do someday, or maybe not do at all? Things has a place for this, which I will show you in the upcoming section. Is this something that I can delegate to someone else? Am I waiting for someone else to do this action? Can I do this anytime I want, or is it better that I don’t even see this until an upcoming date? Is this something I will ever attempt to do, or is it not worth worrying about at all? You may want to just delete it! Is the title of this to-do something that represents an outcome that I want to see happen, or something that I can actually physically, visibly see myself doing?

- You should think of a due date as the date which, if the item is not completed by, bad things will happen. ([Location 310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074D51BB2&location=310))
- I use Tags like GTD uses Contexts. That is, my tags represent the person, tool, or thing that I need in front of me to be able to move forward with the action. When you apply a tag to every single to-do in Things, you are doing yourself a favor - you will be able to stay in that context, remain focused on doing the same type of work, yet move several projects and single actions forward. ([Location 356](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074D51BB2&location=356))
- Move the weekly review project to an area like, "Maintenance", etc. ([Location 493](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B074D51BB2&location=493))
