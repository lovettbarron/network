## Highlights
- Every new technology put out on the market is introduced with assertions and assumptions about how it will be used, but it’s only through actual experience that “use” is defined, shaped by any number of factors including context, personality, motivation, and income. ([Location 89](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=89))
- Nick Hughes and Susie Lonie of Vodafone UK, with seed funding from the United Kingdom’s Department for International Development, ([Location 158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=158))
- emergent behaviors, essentially things that people have only recently started doing and that might, if the conditions are right, become widespread. ([Location 167](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=167))
- situations—people whose situation or context pushes them to make the most of what is currently available regardless of existing social or legal norms. Call it innovation by necessity. These people are often called “extreme” or “lead users.” ([Location 173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=173))
- If you used your sense of “why” to uncover the truth about what low-income people want by talking to the people who know best—those people themselves—you’d find that they are in fact some of the world’s toughest customers. ([Location 200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=200))
- The Nano still has tremendous potential, since a $2,900 car—a functional one—can be a disruptive force of change in the marketplace, just as a $100 laptop or a $20 mobile phone can. These objects can be powerful tools in people’s everyday lives, if they actually help people overcome the fundamental obstacles they face—transportation, education, communication, and so on—and are designed as desirable objects that convey a positive image of their owners. ([Location 204](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=204))
- It starts with the scouting process, looking for the neighborhoods where the team can get a sense of the denizens’ everyday lives. ([Location 224](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=224))
- Cruising through the city on bikes doesn’t feel like work, but it gives us a chance to rapidly engage with the environment on a human level. ([Location 238](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=238))
- One of my favorite ways to do this early on in the study, and one of simplest, is to wake up with the city. Gather the team before dawn, find an appropriate neighborhood, then cruise around together while the shopkeepers are lifting their shutters, as newspapers hit the pavement and locals step out for their morning constitutionals. The morning rush for essentials—from coffee or chai to fresh pastries to rice porridge—is a ritual virtually everywhere, making it ripe for cross-cultural comparisons. If there’s a long line, all the better: our job, after all, is to strike up conversations. ([Location 241](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=241))
- My colleagues and I spend a great deal of time thinking about touchpoints—the times and places where users would likely be interacting with the product or service we’re designing—and triggers that would prompt users to act in one way or another during those times and in those places. These factors can highlight new opportunities to serve unmet needs, or to better tailor products ([Location 322](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=322))
- To a client or outside observer, design ideas that aren’t presented within a research-based, real-world framework can seem arbitrary. For organizations that were weaned on quantitative market research, it’s not enough to be inspired—they want to be able to trace that inspiration back to its source. ([Location 341](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=341))
- Data, like milk, is best consumed fresh; the longer we take to analyze it, the more likely we are to lose the thread that connects it to its original meaning. At some point in the day the team heads back to our “mission control,” most often a room in a hotel, guesthouse, or home, where the walls are papered with notes and ideas. Before leaving the city, while we still have access to our local team, we like to spend a full day sifting through the data. ([Location 346](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=346))
- If there’s such a thing as a default framework in corporate research, it’s the customer journey map, which provides detailed information about each event in a customer’s typical day, diagrams how she moves from one event to another, and identifies all the touchpoints where she may use the product or service we’re designing. ([Location 358](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=358))
- Threshold mapping allows us to map out “default” conditions—the normal state a person experiences a majority of the time (for example, most people feel clean enough throughout the day that they won’t drop whatever they’re doing and hop in the shower if it’s available)—and then understand what happens when a person crosses the line into an alternative condition. Often, the feelings that people experience as they approach or cross a threshold lead them to think and act differently. ([Location 365](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=365))
- plot the different places that you go during the day, and the time you spend there: ([Location 385](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=385))
- The vertical axis, in this case, indicates your level of hunger. Now plot three lines along the timeline: your level of hunger, as it varies throughout the day; ([Location 387](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=387))
- The area between the two thresholds is your comfort zone, and in normal circumstances you’ll do what it takes to stay within that zone. ([Location 389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=389))
- It’s a simple exercise but one that can deliver a large payoff, revealing both a richer understanding of what people are and are not doing, what triggers them to go outside their zone of comfort, and more important, why. The format also allows an audience to rapidly absorb the basics, and supports an incredible level of depth and storytelling, particularly around the exceptions. ([Location 408](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=408))
- In my experience, companies have a reasonable understanding of what is normal but struggle with the extremes, which means they don’t understand the tensions that pull normal in different directions. Just think: ([Location 417](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=417))
- Understanding the exceptions and the behaviors needed to bring you back into the comfort zone often reveals little things that might turn out to not be so little: ([Location 421](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=421))
- They all took steps to stay within their own desired comfort zones, but the dimensions of those zones looked very different when we plotted them out. ([Location 455](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=455))
- “comfort zone” loosely to describe the area where a person maintains the status ([Location 457](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=457))
- quo for everyday life, going about business as usual, which typically means not engaging in the behavior we’re studying. ([Location 457](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=457))
- This qualitative data suggested that the trough threshold for grooming exists at the point where someone is unwilling to engage in any social interaction (or some specific interaction at that point, like a meeting or a date) without first freshening up somehow. ([Location 464](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=464))
- sociologist Mark Granovetter. ([Location 493](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=493))
- each individual in the crowd makes a personal decision to riot or not, based on perceptions about the benefits of rioting (a cathartic release of anger) versus the risks (the possibility of arrest). ([Location 502](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=502))
- designers first have to establish that a threshold exists, then ([Location 524](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=524))
- pinpoint it, figure out how to maintain it, and try to expand the comfort zone. Consider the ways people have managed thresholds of sleep over the course of history. ([Location 525](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=525))
- An empty wallet is a strong and very concrete feedback mechanism for cash transactions. ([Location 563](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=563))
- On the less tangible side, psychologists have found that people with any hint of miserly tendencies use a feedback system in the area of the brain known as the insula, which generates feelings of disgust when we encounter an unpleasant odor, a horrid picture, or, it seems, a budget-shattering pair of ([Location 563](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=563))
- Bruno Magli shoes. But when we use credit cards, debit cards, and mobile wallets, we don’t get to peer into the void of a wallet, and we can’t always count on our insulae to steer us right. This is where good service design comes in. ([Location 565](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=565))
- In The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life, sociologist Erving Goffman’s seminal analysis of social dynamics, Goffman describes interactions in terms of dramatic performance, in which every individual involved plays dual roles of performer and audience. ([Location 615](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=615))
- rudeness is simply a matter of staging the wrong performance in the wrong scene. ([Location 622](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=622))
- The “Veblen effect” was coined in 1950 by economist Harvey Leibenstein, who pointed out that consumer demand depended not only on the functional utility of goods but also on certain social factors: a desire to be “in style” (the “bandwagon effect”); a desire to stand out from the herd (the “snob effect”); and a desire for “conspicuous consumption,” a term ([Location 649](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=649))
- introduced a half-century earlier by sociologist Thorstein Veblen. ([Location 652](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=652))
- You could say it’s the market force of superstition, but at heart it’s the force of impression management. ([Location 698](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=698))
- it’s good to understand why we don’t break unwritten rules, instead of just assuming that we can’t, I decided to try a little experiment. ([Location 711](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=711))
- In Kate Fox’s book Watching the English, she notes a curious arc in class preferences for “bogside reading,” the books and magazines that the English strategically place in their bathrooms for, ahem, extended visits. ([Location 724](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=724))
- Fridges and kitchens are the low-hanging fruit of ([Location 752](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=752))
- in-home research: they’re generally considered neutral for guests to wander into, and the hosts usually assume that there’s not too much that can be revealed. ([Location 753](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=753))
- One of my favorite examples of masstige is the Apple earbuds found in-ear or dangling from the necks of commuters in cities all over the world. They cost about half as much as the cheapest iPod, and perhaps one-tenth as much as an iPhone, but for someone who can’t afford the core technology products the earbuds are a gateway into the Apple ecosystem. As former Apple marketing executive Steve Chazin put it, “Wear white headphones and you are a member of the club.” Who cares if they’re plugged into a cheap knockoff phone in your pocket? It’s what’s outside that counts. ([Location 773](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=773))
- This seems to suggest that as society becomes more hyperconnected, the ability to disconnect and stay disconnected will become a more significant sign of status. If ([Location 783](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=783))
- technology amplifies behavior. It helps those who are trying to do good do more good, and it helps those who are trying to do bad do more bad. ([Location 785](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=785))
- Another consequence of miniaturization is that as devices move away from visual interfaces and become strictly audio, the only element of the interface that can be flaunted for status purposes will be the conversation itself. ([Location 795](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=795))
- umbrella of categories, courtesy of evolutionary psychologist Geoffrey Miller: physical attributes, including health, fertility, and beauty; personality traits, such as conscientiousness, agreeableness, and openness to novelty; and cognitive ones, namely general intelligence. ([Location 823](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=823))
- Think about the cumulative sum of all traits, positive and negative, a person displays through objects and appearances—what Goffman would call “performance equipment”—at any given time. ([Location 826](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=826))
- Japan boasts a tightly integrated high-tech manufacturing base and, perhaps more important, established relationships between people and companies that allow even further integration. ([Location 858](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=858))
- benefits of adoption are promoted through another message: that you are less likely to inconvenience others. ([Location 865](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=865))
- economist Joe Bohlen and sociologist George Beal, ([Location 882](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=882))
- Beal and Bohlen called the “diffusion process,” breaks down into five discrete stages that an individual goes through on the path to adoption. ([Location 884](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=884))
    - Tags: [blue](blue.md) 
- breakdown of the “adoption curve”: who adopts first, last, and in between. ([Location 897](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=897))
- innovators possess a large amount of risk capital—they can afford to try out new things without worrying too much about losing money or prestige if they fail. ([Location 899](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=899))
- When Beal and Bohlen published their hybrid corn seed adoption studies, they claimed they were only focused on two main ideas that were more or less obvious: that adoption is not a spontaneous decision but rather occurs in stages; and that not everyone adopts at once. ([Location 924](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=924))
- adoption behaviors offer a wonderful lens into the tensions and pressures that people—and societies—face when confronted with something new. ([Location 929](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=929))
- “Google Effects on Memory: Cognitive Consequences of Having Information at Our Fingertips,” ([Location 937](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=937))
- What Beal and Bohlen only hinted at, and what I believe qualitative, in-context research can fundamentally tap into, are the social pressures that contribute to that segmentation, and how those pressures cascade along the curve as adopters exert their influence on those who have yet to adopt. ([Location 950](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=950))
- That “future shock,” as futurist Alvin Toffler once called the psychological effect of “too much change in too short a period of time,” is a phenomenon that has existed throughout the lifetime of every living person on earth today, but the dynamics of how this plays out, the speed at which it occurs, and the consequences of adopting or not adopting in the face of it are constantly changing. Around the same time as I ([Location 978](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=978))
- That influence can come from mass media, but most often it comes from peers. To borrow the old adage about politics, all adoption is local. Well, almost all. ([Location 997](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=997))
- Thomas Valente, ([Location 998](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=998))
- Network Models of the Diffusion of Innovations, he theorized that adoption behavior could be predicted using a threshold model (sound familiar?) of networks. The key factor in adoption, he argued, is the number of one’s peers who adopt an innovation; when that number reaches the individual’s threshold, that individual will in turn adopt the innovation.

- one, that the adoption curve timeline only tells part of the story, and people who adopt at the same time are not necessarily influenced in the same way; ([Location 1013](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=1013))
- some people, regardless of whether they’re early adopters, in the majority, or laggards, are immediately influenced by their peers while others will monitor their peers’ behavior for some time before making a decision; ([Location 1014](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=1014))
    - Tags: [blue](blue.md) 
- that people who may be considered laggards relative to the greater social system could be early adopters within their own personal networks, or vice versa, depending on how their networks are externally connected to the social system. ([Location 1016](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=1016))

- But because their traditional ways teach them to remain separate from the rest of society, they thus have to stay off the electricity grid. “The Amish noticed that when their homes were electrified with wires from a generator in town, they became more tied to the rhythms, policies, and concerns of the town. Amish religious belief is founded on the principle that they should remain ‘in the world, not of it’ and so they should remain separate in as many ways as possible.” ([Location 1087](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=1087))
- In person, you can gain insight into the social barriers unique to a culture, and whether adoption is purely driven by reflective appeal (status), behavioral appeal (usefulness), or the relative importance of one over the other. If you do the research right, it will allow you to tap into the sentiment of adoption, which you’ll never get from looking at quantified data. ([Location 1093](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=1093))
- One technology already making waves, but for which the biggest disruption is yet to come, is near-time facial recognition: the ability to capture someone’s face and accurately match it to their online identity (and everything attached to it), all within the time it takes to say “hi.” ([Location 1125](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=1125))
- On one hand, it’s comforting to think they’d have a tool to sniff me out and discover my intent; on the other hand, if they were the type to be suspicious of any foreigner with a corporate background, I wouldn’t be able to conceal that connection from them. ([Location 1146](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=1146))
- But just as all things have an adoption curve, they also have an abandonment curve. ([Location 1153](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=1153))
- Hints to behaviors past lie all around us: people holding up virtual lighters on their phone screens at concerts; nomenclature like glove compartment, pen pal, and disc jockey; and even the iconography on our computers that points back to the physical objects we’ve since abandoned in favor of the applications those icons represent—notepads, envelopes, paper clips, and fountain pens. ([Location 1157](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=1157))
- the things we carry, the things we absolutely need when we go out into the world, are the tools that help us survive. In more than a decade of research on this topic, I’ve found the keys-money-phone triumvirate to be consistent across cultures, gender, economic strata, and age ([Location 1185](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=1185))
- minute or two. When she realized this, she was visibly upset with herself that she had let her guard ([Location 1213](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=1213))

- When risk and convenience factors are low, objects are allowed to spread out; when convenience is high, they stay close by; when risk is high, they stay somewhere safe, which could be very close, very deep under lock and key, or even somewhere completely intangible (we’ll come back to that last one later). ([Location 1221](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=1221))
- The ability to project status in the form of tangible objects depends on their (momentary, at the very least) visibility but also highlights an inherent tension: the desire to show off one’s property versus the desire to keep it safe. ([Location 1246](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=1246))
- To counter this natural tendency to forget important objects, one of the simple, widespread ([Location 1262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=1262))
- behaviors people exhibit when leaving one space and heading to another is what we call a point of reflection, that moment when a person pauses in order to run through a mental checklist of what they’re carrying and what they may be forgetting. ([Location 1263](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=1263))
- technique—literally sifting through and documenting the contents of people’s wallets and/or bags, and asking about the stories behind each object—is that people often do things to compensate when things like fare cards aren’t designed with adequate points of reflection. ([Location 1273](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=1273))
- In 2010, mobile telecom provider Roshan and the Afghan Ministry of the Interior set up a pilot program to explore paying police officers’ salaries via a mobile banking system called M-Paisa.* Instead of receiving bundles of cash from their commanding officers, the police who participated in the M-Paisa program were notified by text message that their salaries had been credited to their accounts, which they could cash out through any Roshan agent in the country. To their surprise, many officers found that they had received “raises”—sometimes as much as a third more than they were accustomed to getting. In fact, they were getting their full, actual salaries for the first time, as the money digitally slipped through the sticky fingers of the higher-ups who had been skimming off the top.

- Entrepreneur and author Lisa Gansky calls this “the Mesh,” a model for consumption based on network-enabled sharing, providing access rather than ownership. ([Location 1429](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=1429))
- Over the next few years we’re likely to see more points of reflection designed into objects that are increasingly connected to one another. ([Location 1453](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=1453))
- When you want to know how and why people do the things they do, the best people to learn from are the doers themselves, and the best place to learn is where the doing gets done. ([Location 1482](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=1482))
- “rapid cultural calibration”—not only putting yourself in the local mind-set but also putting local phenomena into global perspective, implicitly and sometimes explicitly. ([Location 1495](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=1495))
- Rapid cultural calibration can take the form of a stroll at dawn or a rush-hour subway ride; a visit to a barbershop, a train station, or the local outpost of a global chain restaurant; or even a slight pause for contemplation at the sight of signage. ([Location 1498](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=1498))
- Used in conjunction with more structured techniques such as in-depth interviews, surveys, and home visits—and when applied in multiple neighborhoods, cities, or countries—rapid cultural calibration can help deepen your understanding of a new culture and compare it with your own and others you’ve visited. Each calibration session can take as little as thirty minutes, or stretch as long as half a day (though if you were so inclined, you could do them ad infinitum, but in that case they wouldn’t be particularly rapid). ([Location 1499](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=1499))
- You can never understand the stresses and pains a city’s inhabitants feel until you’ve felt the worst of its commute. ([Location 1546](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=1546))
- It turns out being able to plan ahead for a predictable commuter experience is a big part of quality of life, even if it means planning ahead for sitting in traffic. ([Location 1556](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=1556))
- These are the sorts of questions that come up when our teams venture into the melee of the daily commute, and the answers are incredibly important in understanding research participants’ lives. In the span of most in-depth interviews, the discussion of commuting might last only a minute or two, but by experiencing a city’s commute for yourself you gain a better sense of the mental and physical state in which people arrive for work or school in the morning and back home in the evening. ([Location 1561](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008B0ULDW&location=1561))
- For the price of a cut or shave, that seat is as much yours as any local’s, and once you’re in it you have as much right to steer the conversation as anyone in the room.

- The mere existence of a sign reveals that whatever issue it pertains to is important enough for someone, presumably an authority on the matter, to invest time and energy to discuss the possibility of a formal or informal ban with other people in the know, commission production of the sign (or urge someone else to rubber-stamp it), and have it installed.

- In most instances, these signs aren’t put in place to issue firm directives and control behavior (much as authoritarian urban planners might fantasize); they’re there because the person(s) who wants to control behavior lacks the power or presence to do so and believes an authoritative-seeming sign can serve as enforcer.

- In many ways a sign can be a last resort, a footnote to a space whose purpose could and perhaps should have been planned better for intuitive use, sans written directions. Urban planners, architects, and designers have created a whole vocabulary of uncomfortable addendums—urban forms with cues to influence behaviors—such as rows of small spikes to stop people from sitting on ledges or low flat walls; metal bobbles welded to rails to keep skateboarders off; and starbursts of spikes on pigeon-prone surfaces.

(In this case “rational” refers to those things that have an immediate benefit to their current socioeconomic situation, as defined by the person making the argument. For example, that it’s okay to spend money on medicine for a sick kid, but not on electricity that allows that sick kid to watch TV.) • Any time a consumer makes an “irrational” choice the “fault” lies with the company providing the products. • Companies that target consumers in countries with very low levels of income are inherently evil.
