## Highlights
- This peculiarity is that when a unit has once achieved real distinction, once it has become really good, rather than simply thinking it is good---it stays good. When there is nothing left of the original organization but the signs and the flags, the previously established reputation feeds upon itself.  The people who formed this reputation, the men who created the excellence, may have been dead and gone a hundred years; but if the excellence they first created was good enough, it is of itself self perpetuating. ([Location 49](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0081UFP6A&location=49))
- Generation after generation, in country after country, and against successive waves of barbarians, there was always the Tenth. ([Location 63](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0081UFP6A&location=63))
- They approach the killing with anticipation and in the event the kill is successfully made, feel absolutely no remorse—only a sensation of satisfaction and fulfillment. Men who deny this basic truth lie. Men who do not wish to kill need only to stop. The ultimate difficulty that you can build into the game is not to play it at all. ([Location 95](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0081UFP6A&location=95))
- I suspect that the miserable specimens of lieutenants extant today are caused by a little known scientific fact—the fact that gravity today is much stronger than it used to be. I am sure you must have noticed it. It undoubtedly has somehow affected both the physical and the intellectual development of our young men. ([Location 324](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0081UFP6A&location=324))
- Anybody who has watched the conduct of one of these hatches in chicken yards, as soon as they were a week old, would have the same confidence as I do that these birds are even wilder than preachers’ daughters and have not changed since the day the Vikings landed.

- His eyesight, especially when it comes to detecting motion, is no less than marvelous, and his hearing simply defies belief. He can hear you yelp at a quarter of a mile, can instantly from that single sound absolutely fix both your direction and your distance and could, if he wanted to, pitch directly from the tree in which he sits and light on your head. He is utterly and wholly suspicious of everything and everybody and unless he is taken over bait or is shot at long range with a rifle has all the cards. Not only does he hold all the good cards, he can read the backs of yours. ([Location 616](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0081UFP6A&location=616))
- They imply that it would be dangerous to yelp like this at all, unless you were firmly backed up against a tree before you did it, because if you were not, instant ravishment by sex-crazed gobblers might occur before you could turn around to protect your innocence. ([Location 694](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0081UFP6A&location=694))
- The Lord, or the computer, or the system will provide. ([Location 755](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0081UFP6A&location=755))
- In cultivated societies there are certain things that simply are not done. ([Location 811](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0081UFP6A&location=811))
