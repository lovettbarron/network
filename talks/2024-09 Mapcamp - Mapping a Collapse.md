# Mapping a Collapse: Climate Change and the Syrian Civil War

### Talk Pitch
How do we separate the effects of a system from the effects of our strategies?

The Syrian civil war was a human tragedy with a climate-inflected twist. Early on, international observers blamed climate change on the desertification and migration that set the scene for the 2011 conflict — an argument that the Syrian Government has used to deflect blame. 

However, later analysis showed that flawed agricultural policies focused on food sovereignty and security were the primary culprit for mass migration to urban areas — establishing the powder keg for what was to come.

In this quick talk, we'll use Wardley maps to break down and merge the two arguments — Climate vs. Policy. The goal is to demonstrate how we can use mapping as a kind of strategy forensics tool when looking at our operating climate vs. our actions.

### Key notes
- The primary catalyst for the Syrian civil war (extractive, non-renewing agricultural subsidies) could have been anticipated by researchers and policy officials. 
- The Syrian Civil War was misunderstood by international observers as a climate change exacerbated crisis, vs. one catalyzed by policy
- Wardley Maps can be leveraged to see where the analysis went sideways. 
	- Identifying how the food security thesis resulted in a misattribution of commodities 
	- Identifying how observers misattributed the war's catalyst as climate change effects (which existed, but weren't the driver)
- Using climate change and the civil war as a particularly brutal parable about 
## History
- The Syrian Civil War catalyzed in 2010, but emerged from decades of governmental mismanagement from the Assad regime across three topics: aggricultural subsidies, rural land use, and corruption.
- The Assad regime (Hafez) was motivated to explore a specific idea of food security/sovereignty within the Middle east. This created a state subsidy program for both grain purchase and cheap use of fossil fuel to provide for ground-water based irrigation. Behind all of this, corruption was rampant.
- By the mid 2000s, ground water for irrigation was already becoming increasingly difficult to access and the government under Bashar al-Assad removed the fuel subsidies that made it possible in the first place. Rapidly, the agricultural sector was gutted and a substantial migration away from rural environments to cities took place. 
- This created the backdrop for the Syrian civil war
