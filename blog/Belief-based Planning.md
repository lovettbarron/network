Figuring out how to do something new is hard. 

We have to navigate the realities of structural circumstances (eg. markets), individual circumstances (eg. capital and network), temporal circumstances (eg. interest rates and trends), etc. Add to this we have our whole internal world to navigate: our influences, past ideas, traumas and triumphs. These things construct our beliefs and narratives over time, accumulating and ossifying.

These factors fold themselves over to limit our capacity to see what is coming before us.

Distance becomes deceptive without landmarks: Have we been here before and how do we calculate our path? Gracefully, landmarks tend to unveil themselves over time if they do exist at all. I beat the prototyping drum a lot, and here's that timpani once more: prototyping is landmark making.

Our own mechanisms to sense the world are rarely consistent across the team: physical, neurological, and experiential differences make themselves known here.  Our own sensors are what they are: that physical, neurological, or experiential context that we bring to the table. We can augment this (doctrinal decision making a-la OODA loop; chemical augmentation like adderall, fitness, education in technique and philosophy) but we are our own bricolage.

And then the environment and its climate steps in to affect us; shaping not just how we navigate the terrain, but also how we perceive it. What do we do when the environment itself is against us? 

## Player vs. Environment (PvE)
 
A lot can go on in our little societal troposphere. Some of the easiest to imagine are:

- **Economic Systems**: Interest rates are skyrocketing and all the previous patterns simply don't work anymore. The tools you used in the past to see "value" just don't make sense in this environment. A key resource you depended on (cheap debt) is no longer available.
- **Market Dynamic**: Everyone is being laid off, and the supply/demand environment your skillset has existed within simply doesn't apply anymore. Regardless of your own experience, the "map" you used is losing credibility.
- **Global Social Tsunami**: You are constantly bombarded with credible threat and opportunity signals, even though those signals don't apply to you locality or timeline. Your sensory model for stress response is going haywire. (Social media can really bang the drum on this one)

Few things are as real as the distance between two points (Physicists, don't @ me), but these environmental factors distort our understanding of point B relative to our current position at Point A, similar to [Voros' cone of possibility](https://thevoroscope.com/2017/02/24/the-futures-cone-use-and-history/).

All things being equal, we hit the projected future — probably. But we might suppose that we can shift that narrative somewhat.

So much of the futures studies language and tooling revolve around a core conceit that we can look ahead to what may come (usually using different combinatorial tools, models, and narratives) given KNOWN patterns, and shift our trajectory towards a more preferable outcome. We end up making a decision based off of what we believe (or want to believe) we see in the distance — knowing that we look through the mist, heat haze, tempest, and turmoil of environmental distortion.

## The Belief before the Storm
Lacking sensory data, narratives and beliefs become our navigation tools. 

Narratives give a structure and a degree of continuity to the experiences we are trying to parse — as well as painting experiences with the nuance of values, social constructs, risk, etc. Narcissus' grim curse puts the negative frame around self obsession; as well as Penelope's cleverness and patience share the values of that culture alongside construct of a gendered heroism.

Beliefs are the interpretation and action that we bring to experience and anticipation. **Systemic beliefs** are macro-effectors on the way that we navigate our world. We might hold a systemic value-driven belief like "gambling is morally wrong and corrupting" or "design thinking results in better product/service outcomes." Systemic beliefs carry across the subject's experiences and world view — such that they usually must be accounted for in your interactions with them.

**Localized beliefs** are trigger-specific beliefs that are basically weird modifiers on our perception: "I got sick when I ate hotpot therefore hotpot is the devil", or "I was weird that one time so Joan thinks I'm weird", or "I was successful in my last project, and so future projects have to create outcomes that LOOK like that project" The trigger for a localized belief can be people, places, experiences, etc. But they tend to be a bit unexpected: an otherwise critical leader with a specific phobia, ritual, or bias.

Narratives then structure these systemic and localized beliefs into a frame that is legible (though not always reasonable) for us. A common designer trope is one where the young designer holds a semi-heroic narrative around their role in a process: they structurally believe in individual exceptionalism reinforced through more macro-narratives like 21st century software entrepreneurialism and national rhetoric. This systemic belief is reinforced and contextualized by their localized beliefs, such as experiences carrying a group project at school ("I always get the job done, with or without others"), filtered work experiences ("I'm chosen over others for this type of work"), and idiosyncratic expertise ("My experience as a printmaker means I understand process in a unique way"). This bundling of systemic and localized believes construct a specific narrative for this person which serve to obfuscate root cause and rationale for each individual belief — making it incredibly difficult to untangle.

Because of this tangling, narratives and beliefs are excruciating to manipulate in oneself. It's one of the main reasons to work with a coach (though this is its own fraught pathway). The start of that process is to make internal narratives and beliefs legible within our own frame of introspection. This legibility becomes the baseline for us to understand how we interpret the environment, and presents a toolkit for sharing that legibility with others.

## Belief Casting
The first thing to we need to do is to place our beliefs and internal narratives as part of the terrain — a landmark within which we can shelter and against which we can navigate. We get something between a lighthouse and a star.

The lighthouse gives us context, albeit difficult to interpret. These are the localized beliefs that present some barrier against which we can avoid or steer towards: but without always a clear reason why. The star is our systemic framing: we unconsciously and consciously navigate by it when making sense of an environment, but it is also an environmental constant against which we can leverage finer-grained tools — from holding up our thumb to fashioning a sextant.

Stepping back from metaphor for a moment, backcasting is my go-to planning tool for making sense of work that needs to exist in the future. You start with where you're currently at, project forward to where you want to be (perhaps with a few variations of where you want to be), and work backwards from that point. What needs to be true? Who needs to be involved? What needs to exist or be eliminated? Backcasting creates todo list to get to the future, with opportunities to "diverge" along unknown continuums.

Belief-casting takes the same core tenant of backcasting, but adds the visible dimensions of belief and narrative to action and logistics. If I believe that that serverless is the best path for a project and I KNOW that I believe this, that belief becomes a pivot point: working backwards from project completion, one lane becomes backcasting along the serverless dimension, another along more traditional infrastructural modes. 

If I adhere to a more worker-centric narrative around wellbeing and work-life balance (eg. working hours, location, paternity leave, etc), does the map I created align with that narrative? What other things must be true? What risks are incurred by attaching to that narrative framing?

The approach of belief casting puts a LOT of pressure on an otherwise anodyne planning and foresight tool, but essentially **adds a topographic layer** to what otherwise would only show distance, landmarks, and cardinal directions. 

Take a startup: Its founders share a (laudable) narrative of worker-centric team culture, but also buy into the the systemic beliefs of the venture capital ecosystem (high pre-revenue capex; intense effort and risk around product-market-fit pivots; high overall risk to both product and employee). What happens when this company encounters the unexpected? What happens when productivity lags, or directions are ambiguous? What happens when a team accustom to being present in the evening with their family hits a series of pre-raise pivot?

Belief casting creates a structure to interrogate those questions directly, creating a set of artefacts that invite iteration as time and work roll onwards. 

## Very Simple Example
Let's do a dead simple example. I'm going to skip a LOT of steps, but if you have any questions [just send me a note](mailto:alb@andrewlb.com).
The easiest way to actually run a belief casting activity is to run a backcasting activity first. Start with the dates and work backwards from there. You'll get usually get a pretty idealized path like this.

Then take that and break it off into some potential "risk" pathways. What are some alternative paths that might occur? In this scenario we are looking at time for an outcome we know, but this might be an opportunity to look at alternative preferable outcomes. In this example, we just have some alternative outcomes from testing that results in a pushed timeline.

With the basic project skeleton in place, take a step back and try to interrogate some of the core beliefs or values you have about your startup. The best case scenario here is that founders have gotten some coaching or conseling, and have a kind of legibility to their own belief system. Worst case, use the startup as a foil to embed beliefs into and treat this like a brand-building or value-identifying activity. [I'm posting examples of these kinds of activities on instagram, and will link to specifics when they're up.](https://instagram.com/megafauna.cph)

Usually at this stage, you'll want to sort and categorize these beliefs somehow. This should give you a handful of categories that you can start applying to "points" along your backcast journey. It should be rough, critical, and argumentative at this stage.

As you go through this process, you'll start to surface some pretty clear tradeoffs between these beliefs. In this context, we're starting to see that the employee-centric and ego-centric values start to suffer as soon as they come across the user centric events. 
![Screenshot 2024-05-13 at 11.26.17.png](Screenshot%202024-05-13%20at%2011.26.17.png)

This quick example shows that while the plan and pivot points themselves are logical relative to the structural dogma of this type business, the results are counter to their professed beliefs EVEN when they get lucky.

In the middle "ideal" scenario, founder taste-making (ego-centrism) raises an initial round, and magically aligns with user needs (user-centrism). The team is stressed leading into launch, but overall the outcome is good with customer demand leading the next round.

In the more likely scenario (top), founder test-making raises a round and defines the core product, but it doesn't meet the need. Testing becomes delayed by the "taste making" belief — and by the time the product meets the user a substantial portion of the runway has been used up. What results is a user-centric win for the product is purchased at the expense of the employee-centric and ego-centric beliefs.

This example shows a set of beliefs being frontloaded into the process, but which don't actually map towards the recurring need of the outcome. If you hire based on one set of beliefs, but your process REQUIRES a different set of beliefs to get to the outcome you describe, then these systems will come into natural conflict.

## Finding Shelter
This kind of belief casting map presents a dilemma. If we're risking this much in venturing out, why do so at all? By applying a layer of belief-based interrogation overtop of the actual dates and activities, it gives us a sense of where things come into conflict and where we might try to push. Our start point and endpoint might be the same, but suddenly we have a different tool around which to reorganize our activities.

Here's one alternative that might emerge from this interrogation of the previous map. Because the series A raise is based on some level of customer demand and PMF, we orient the early activities around that belief. 
![Screenshot 2024-05-13 at 11.38.23.png](Screenshot%202024-05-13%20at%2011.38.23.png)

This includes how we MIX and ALIGN beliefs to get us to better outcomes. Early user-centric activities can be mixed with employee-centric activities and ego-centric activities. Including early employees in need discovery augments their own strongly held opinions (ego-centrism), and gives them clarity around their advancement in the company (employee-centrism).

This redefined map is far from perfect: it will require a lot more interrogation and perhaps a return to more detailed back-casting and scenario planning — especially because we default to an idealized single scenario after doing such refinement. Functionally, we've converged on a solution through a belief-driven filtering process, and the smart next step is to diverge again and run the new plan through a gauntlet. 

But whatever needs to happen next, **with this approach we've explicitly integrated our beliefs and narratives into our planning activities.** When hard decisions come down the road, we'll be equipped to balance those decisions against the choice and circumstance that got us there. We can't control our environments, but when we do head out into inclement weather, we have agency over our attitudes and our preparedness. Belief-casting is a shortcut to both.
