I have terrible taste in film. I once suggested Zardoz to a first date, am a huge fan of the Conan movies and am a sucker for any given action film that happens to flit across my radar with at least somewhat recognizable tropes.

So when Army of the Dead popped up on Netflix as a two-and-a-half hour collection of metastasized genre tropes, I was pretty obviously going to watch it. And it was everything I could have hoped for.
